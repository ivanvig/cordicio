# Cordicio
Chisel implementation of a CORDIC, supports vector and rotation mode in circular domain

Cordicio is a [Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel)
implementation of a [CORDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC).

It currently supports rotation and vectoring mode in circular domain and works
on any quadrant.

# Getting Started

Using as a [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) core:

Add the FuseSoC generator library to get the chisel generator

``` console
$ fusesoc library add fusesoc-generators-lib https://github.com/fusesoc/fusesoc-generators
```

Add the Cordicio repo as a library to access the core

``` console
$ fusesoc library add cordicio-lib https://github.com/ivanvig/cordicio
```

Use it in your own core by declaring `ivanvig:math:cordicio` as a
dependency.

The FuseSoC chisel generator will automatically generate the Verilog
source code from the chisel sources

The Verilog source code can also be generated by running

``` console
$ sbt run
```
